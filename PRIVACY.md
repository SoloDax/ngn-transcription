# Privacy Policy — NGN – AI Audio Transcription

**Last updated: February 17, 2026**

## Overview

NGN is an open-source Chrome extension that provides real-time speech-to-text transcription and translation. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**NGN does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

Specifically, we do NOT collect:
- Personal information (name, email, address)
- Browsing history or website activity
- Location data
- Health or financial information
- User activity tracking or analytics

## How the Extension Works

- **Audio processing**: When you start a recording session, tab audio is streamed directly to the Soniox API (soniox.com) for transcription. Audio is processed in real-time and is not stored by the extension.
- **API key**: Your Soniox API key is stored locally in Chrome's storage on your device only. It is never transmitted anywhere except to Soniox's API for authentication.
- **Settings**: All preferences (language, caption style, etc.) are stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API.

## Third-Party Services

NGN uses the **Soniox Speech-to-Text API** (soniox.com) to process audio. Audio data is sent to Soniox servers for real-time transcription. Please refer to [Soniox's privacy policy](https://soniox.com/privacy) for information on how they handle audio data.
